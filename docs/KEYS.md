# Keyboard bindings

Press `?` in the app for every binding, grouped by where it works, with each command's id.
`:` / Ctrl-P opens the command list.

## Rebinding: `[keys]` in `~/.config/omarchylook/settings.toml`

The file is re-read every couple of seconds, so edits apply without a restart. Problems (unknown ids,
bad keys, two commands on one key) are listed at the top of the `?` help overlay.

```toml
[keys]
preset = "outlook"                      # optional: adds a family of extra bindings (see below)
"mail.archive" = "e"                    # REPLACES the command's keys
"mail.reply"   = ["r", "C-r"]           # several keys for one command
"move.down"    = ["j", "Down", "n"]
"go.mail"      = "g m"                  # a chord: press g, then m
"item.delete"  = []                     # unbind
```

- Key names: a single character (`j`, `G`, `/`, `?`), `Esc Tab S-Tab Enter Space Up Down Left Right PgUp PgDown Home End Delete Backspace F1`–`F12`,
  and `C-x` (Ctrl), `C-S-x` (Ctrl+Shift) for letters and digits. `Ctrl-r`, `Shift-Tab`, `PageUp` are accepted too.
- A binding for a command id replaces all of that command's default keys. A preset only adds keys.
- Keys apply in the command's own scope (Everywhere, a pane, a module). The same key may mean different things in
  different scopes; two commands on one key in the SAME scope, or a key that is also the start of a chord there, is reported as a problem.
- Plain text input fields (search, compose, palette) always get their keys; bindings only apply when no text field has focus.

## Presets

`outlook` keeps the vim keys and adds: Ctrl-R reply, Ctrl-Shift-R reply all, Ctrl-F forward, Delete delete, Backspace archive,
Ctrl-Q read/unread, Ctrl-Shift-V move, Ctrl-Z undo, F9 sync, Ctrl-1..4 Mail / Calendar / People / Tasks.
