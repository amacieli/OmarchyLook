## Key Decisions Made

1. **Bridge modules as pure Rust structs (not cxx-qt macros yet):**
   - Rationale: cxx-qt macro syntax for 0.10 was unclear; pure Rust structs compile cleanly
   - Status: Valid intermediate state; QML exposure via macros deferred to Phase 2 continuation
   - Risk: Minimal — code is forward-compatible with macro bindings

2. **Minimal build.rs (8 lines):**
   - Rationale: CxxQtBuildConfig API uncertainty; avoided speculative API calls
   - Status: Placeholder; will expand once cxx-qt 0.10 documentation is obtained
   - Risk: Build.rs may need revision when implementing full macro bindings

3. **Reference guide as COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md:**
   - Rationale: Centralized, version-controlled documentation for all dependencies
   - Format: Markdown with tables, links, and structured sections
   - Status: Machine-readable; enables future dependency tracking
   - Maintenance: Should be updated when upgrading any dependency

## What's Blocked/Deferred

### Blocked: None (scaffolding phase is unblocked)

### Deferred to Phase 2 Continuation:
1. **cxx-qt macro bindings implementation**
   - Requires: Full cxx-qt 0.10 documentation on `#[qobject]`, `#[qsignal]` macro syntax
   - Scope: Bridge modules must be extended with Qt object macros to expose to QML
   - Est. time: 2–3 hours once documentation is obtained

2. **main.rs with Qt application initialization**
   - Requires: Qt application template, QML engine setup, context property registration
   - Scope: Wire Rust bridges into QML context so QML can call Rust functions
   - Est. time: 1–2 hours

3. **Integration testing with mock data**
   - Scope: Test MailListView with fake email data, verify Qt↔Rust communication
   - Est. time: 1 hour

---

## Next Session (Phase 2 Continuation)

### Priority 1: Implement cxx-qt macro bindings
1. Load COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md for cxx-qt 0.10 documentation link
2. Study cxx-qt macro syntax in official docs
3. Apply `#[cxx_qt::bridge]`, `#[qobject]`, `#[qsignal]`, `#[qslot]` macros to auth_bridge.rs
4. Verify `cargo check` still passes
5. Repeat for settings_bridge.rs, mail_list_bridge.rs, compose_bridge.rs

### Priority 2: Create main.rs with Qt application
1. Initialize QGuiApplication
2. Load QML engine with qml/App.qml
3. Register Rust bridges as QML context properties
4. Test launch with `cargo run`

### Priority 3: Integration test
1. Add mock email data to mail_list_bridge
2. Test MailListView rendering with Rust bridge data
3. Verify button clicks trigger Rust bridge methods
4. Test QML property bindings to Rust structs

### Priority 4 (if time): Phase 3 planning
1. Document full MS Graph API integration scope
2. Plan QML animations and UI refinements
3. Plan OAuth2 device flow UI

## How to Use COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md

### During development:
1. Before implementing a feature, check the reference guide
2. Look up version numbers and API documentation
3. Verify compatibility matrix before upgrading dependencies

### Example workflows:

**Adding a Microsoft Graph API endpoint:**
1. Open COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md → "API Documentation Cheat Sheet"
2. Navigate to "Microsoft Graph Mail API" section
3. Find the relevant endpoint in "Common Endpoints"
4. Read the official documentation link

**Implementing a Qt QML component:**
1. Open COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md → "How to Use This Guide"
2. Check "Example: Creating a new QML component"
3. Consult the QML Language Reference link
4. Review cxx-qt Book for Rust↔QML patterns

**Upgrading a dependency:**
1. Open COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md → "Version Compatibility Matrix"
2. Check the current version and status
3. Read the GitHub changelog for breaking changes
4. Update version in Cargo.toml
5. Run `cargo check` to verify compatibility
6. Update COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md with new version
7. Commit with a clear message noting verified compatibility

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: cxx-qt macro syntax unclear
- **Status:** Deferred to Phase 2 continuation
- **Workaround:** Pure Rust structs in bridge modules are valid intermediate state
- **Resolution:** Obtain official cxx-qt 0.10 documentation, apply macros

### Issue 2: build.rs is minimal placeholder
- **Status:** Acceptable for Phase 2 scaffolding
- **Workaround:** Current build.rs allows cargo check to pass; full Qt integration deferred
- **Resolution:** Expand build.rs with CxxQtBuildConfig once API is clarified

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Pure Rust structs as bridge placeholders:** Works well when FFI macro syntax is uncertain. Enables compilation and testing without blocking on FFI details.

2. **Component reference guide value:** Centralizing all dependency documentation prevents repeated research and makes phase transitions faster.

3. **QML scaffolding before binding:** Creating QML components first (before Rust bridges) helps clarify the interface design before committing to FFI macros.

4. **Git commit discipline:** Clear, detailed commit messages make it easy to track which feature each file belongs to and why decisions were made.

---

## Phase 2 Success Criteria (All Met ✅)

- ✅ cxx-qt 0.10 and cxx 1.0 dependencies uncommented and enabled
- ✅ Bridge modules created (auth, settings, mail_list, compose)
- ✅ QML scaffolding complete (5 components total)
- ✅ Compilation verified with `cargo check` exit 0
- ✅ Component reference guide with version numbers and API docs
- ✅ Git history clear and well-documented
- ✅ Handoff documentation complete

## Conclusion

Phase 2 scaffolding is complete. All core infrastructure (Rust bridges, QML UI, reference documentation) is in place and compiles cleanly. The foundation is solid for Phase 2 continuation, which will focus on:

1. **Implementing cxx-qt macro bindings** to expose Rust bridges to QML
2. **Creating main.rs** with Qt application initialization
3. **Integration testing** with mock email data
4. **Preparing for Phase 3** (full UI refinement and MS Graph integration)

The COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md is your single source of truth for all dependency versions and API documentation links. Consult it frequently, and update it whenever dependencies are changed.

**Status:** 🟢 Ready for Phase 2 continuation
